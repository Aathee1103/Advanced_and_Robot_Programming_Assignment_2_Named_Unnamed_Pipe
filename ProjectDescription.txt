ProjectDescription.txt file contains useful informations about the project.

Inside the .zip archive are contained five files, three shell scripts the sources.zip archive and the this text file. In the sources archive you find 2 directories wich contain the .c file and also a .txt file with  informations about each process.

First of all to unzip the sources archive and install the program using the command:

source ./install.sh <pathname>

It will create a folder called <pathname> inside which are located the folders that
were in sources.zip, there will also be a folder with the executables of each process.

After that run the program with the command:

./run.sh

This second assignment of ARP is deals with the G1 & G2 process which will communicate with R process using named pipe and unnamed pipe as well. Later, this R process will communicate with M process through both named pipe and unnamed pipe.

The two programs are:

1. named pipe
2. unnamed pipe

In case of named pipe G1 & G2 process communicates with R process using one named pipe between them. But in case of unnamed pipe G1 & G2 process communicates with R process using two unnamed pipe between them.
